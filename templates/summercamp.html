      <h2>Summer Camp</h2>
      <p>Skyline Ranch offers summer camp for kids ages 6 to 15 years. Located in the Oakland Hills, on property owned by the East Bay Regional Parks, Skyline Ranch is a historic center of the Northern California horse community. As home of the Redwood Hills Pony Club, we have years of experience in giving children a solid foundation in horse riding and care, while encouraging safe and confidence-building fun at the barn.</p>
      <p>We accept a small group of kids each session for a week of fun and horseback riding at our facility. Each day, your child will not only take riding lessons designed to give her or him a solid basis in English riding, but also have the fun of learning to groom, feed, lead, bathe and care for a horse, as well as play games, work on art projects, and make new friends.</p>
      <p>With our summer camp as a foundation, your child will be ready to continue on with riding lessons in the fall, or return to camp next year with a strong skill set. Not to mention confidence and sense of accomplishment that time with horses builds – exactly what you want from your child’s summer experience.</p>
